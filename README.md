# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. my first idea is a real estate app using a house listing api for people looking for a house that shows the availible listings in Maryland, Washington DC, and Northern Virginia and connects the user with a realtor using their sign in information(https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/custom-idx-data-api/)
2. my second idea is for the used cars i was thinking a user could put in the necessary information for the user table (name, contact information) but in the second table car and type,color, mile cap that your looking for
and once you make an account you can also post cars that you want to sell also
3. my third idea is a game reviewing app where you can search a game and all of the corrsesponding comments and reviews people have made on it come up and you can add your own comment
